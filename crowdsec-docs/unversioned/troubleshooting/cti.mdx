## False Positive

### How to Get Tagged as a False Positive

To be marked as a false positive in the CrowdSec Threat Intelligence, you need to publicly share all the IP addresses and ranges you own.

Once your IP addresses are publicly available and accessible via HTTPS, you can contact support@crowdsec.net. Please include the URL of your IPs and ranges.

The CrowdSec team will do their best to update the CTI with false positive information, so your IPs are flagged correctly.

Here are some examples of providers who share their IPs and ranges:

-   [Bing](https://www.bing.com/toolbox/bingbot.json)
-   [Google Bot](https://developers.google.com/search/apis/ipranges/googlebot.json)
-   [Cloudfront](https://d7uri8nf7uskq.cloudfront.net/tools/list-cloudfront-ips)
-   [Fastly](https://api.fastly.com/public-ip-list)

:::note

You don’t need to follow a specific format for the exposed list, but it’s recommended to keep the same format over time. Otherwise, the false positive enrichment may stop working.

It’s best to use CSV or JSON for the list format.
