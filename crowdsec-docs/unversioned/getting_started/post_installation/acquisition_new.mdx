:::info
We will be adding a [file based acquisition](/docs/next/data_sources/file). If you need to use a different source then alter the instructions to match your needs.
:::

import UnixWindowsTabs from '../../../src/components/UnixWindowsTabs';


Once you have found service you want to add, you can use the `cscli` command line tool to add the collection.

```bash
cscli collections add <collection_name>
```

Once the collection has been downloaded we need to add a new [Acquisition](https://docs.crowdsec.net/docs/next/data_sources/intro) to the configuration so CrowdSec knows where to find the log source.

:::tip
An example of an [Acquisition](https://docs.crowdsec.net/docs/next/data_sources/intro) is available in the collection on the [Hub](https://hub.crowdsec.net/), which will assist you in identifying the files to monitor and the labels to assign.
:::

:::info
From version `1.5.0` we have added the ability to add acquisitions via the `acquis.d` directory. This allows you to add acquisitions without modifying the main configuration file.
:::

### Create the directory if it does not exist

<UnixWindowsTabs
  bash="sudo mkdir -p /etc/crowdsec/acquis.d"
  cmd="mkdir C:\ProgramData\CrowdSec\Config\acquis.d\"
  powershell="New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path C:\ProgramData\CrowdSec\Config\acquis.d\"
/>

### Create the acquisition file

<UnixWindowsTabs
  bash="sudo touch /etc/crowdsec/acquis.d/<collection_name>.yaml"
  cmd="New-Item -ItemType File -Force -Path C:\ProgramData\CrowdSec\Config\acquis.d\<collection_name>.yaml"
  powershell=".>C:\ProgramData\CrowdSec\Config\acquis.d\<collection_name>.yaml 2>NUL"
/>

### Add the following contents to the file

```yaml title="<collection_name>.yaml"
filesnames:
  - "/path/to/your/file.log" ## Single file
  - "/path/to/your/files*" ## Wildcard support
labels:
  type: "<type of logs>" ## Type defined in the parser
```

Once you have added the acquisitions you can test the configuration and restart the service.

<UnixWindowsTabs
  bash="sudo crowdsec -t && sudo systemctl restart crowdsec"
  cmd="net stop crowdsec && net start crowdsec"
  powershell="Restart-Service crowdsec"
/>

## Next Steps?

Now that you have added a new acquisition, you may want to verify that the logs are being parsed correctly see [are detected log sources working correctly?](/getting_started/post_installation/acquisition.mdx#are-the-detected-log-sources-working-correctly)
