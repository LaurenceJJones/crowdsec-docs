# CrowdSec Hub

The [CrowdSec Hub](https://hub.crowdsec.net/) serves as a repository where individuals can access an array of premade configuration files.

These resources are developed by both the CrowdSec team and the broader community, offering a ready-to-use collection for integrating into your own configurations.

## Hub Tour

The [Hub](https://hub.crowdsec.net/) is divided into many sections, each of which is designed to help you find the right configuration for your needs.

<ThemedImage

    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl("/img/console_hub_light.png"),
        dark: useBaseUrl("/img/console_hub_dark.png"),
    }}
/>

### Collections Tab

[Collections](/docs/next/collections/intro) refers to a set of configurations intended to operate in unison. For instance, the [crowdsecurity/sshd collection](https://app.crowdsec.net/hub/author/crowdsecurity/collections/sshd) includes settings aimed at overseeing attacks towards a SSH server.

<ThemedImage
    alt="CrowdSec sshd collection"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl("/img/console_sshd_collection_light.png"),
        dark: useBaseUrl("/img/console_sshd_collection_dark.png"),
    }}
/>

You can see the contents of the [collection](/docs/next/collections/intro) by viewing the `Content` section.

<ThemedImage
    alt="CrowdSec sshd collection content"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl("/img/console_sshd_collection_content_light.png"),
        dark: useBaseUrl("/img/console_sshd_collection_content_dark.png"),
    }}
/>

As illustrated above, the `sshd` collection encompasses a [parser](/docs/next/parsers/intro) along with [scenarios](/docs/next/scenarios/intro) focused on `brute force` attacks.

### Configurations Tab

The configurations tab holds individual files that can be used with your CrowdSec setup. Each item will include tags to help you identify the intended use case.

<ThemedImage
    alt="CrowdSec configurations"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl("/img/console_configurations_light.png"),
        dark: useBaseUrl("/img/console_configurations_dark.png"),
    }}
/>

For example [apache_log4j2_cve-2021-44228](https://app.crowdsec.net/hub/author/crowdsecurity/configurations/apache_log4j2_cve-2021-44228) is a `Attack scenario` that is designed to detect attacks related to the Apache Log4j2 CVE-2021-44228 vulnerability.

<ThemedImage
    alt="CrowdSec apache_log4j2_cve-2021-44228"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl("/img/console_log4j_light.png"),
        dark: useBaseUrl("/img/console_log4j_dark.png"),
    }}
/>

Another example is [crowdsecurity/nginx-logs](https://app.crowdsec.net/hub/author/crowdsecurity/configurations/nginx-logs) which is a `Log parser` that is designed to parse `Nginx` logs.

<ThemedImage
    alt="CrowdSec nginx-logs"
    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl("/img/console_nginx_logs_light.png"),
        dark: useBaseUrl("/img/console_nginx_logs_dark.png"),
    }}
/>

:::info
There are more configuration types other than `Attack scenario` and `Log parser`. However, these are the most common types.
