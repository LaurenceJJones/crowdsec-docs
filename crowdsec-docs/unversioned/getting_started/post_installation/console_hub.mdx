# CrowdSec Hub

The [CrowdSec Hub](https://hub.crowdsec.net/) serves as a repository where individuals can access an array of premade configuration files.

These resources are developed by both the CrowdSec team and the broader community, offering a ready-to-use collection for integrating into your own configurations.

## Hub Tour

The [Hub](https://hub.crowdsec.net/) is divided into many sections, each of which is designed to help you find the right configuration for your needs.

        dark: useBaseUrl("/img/console_hub_dark.png"),
    }}
/>

### Collections Tab

[Collections](/docs/next/collections/intro) refers to a set of configurations intended to operate in unison. For instance, the [crowdsecurity/sshd collection](https://app.crowdsec.net/hub/author/crowdsecurity/collections/sshd) includes settings aimed at overseeing security breaches on an SSH server.

    sources={{
        light: useBaseUrl("/img/console_sshd_collection_light.png"),
        dark: useBaseUrl("/img/console_sshd_collection_dark.png"),
    }}
/>

### Configurations Tab

The configurations tab holds individual files that can be used to customize your CrowdSec setup. Each item will include tags to help you identify the intended use case.

For example [apache_log4j2_cve-2021-44228](https://app.crowdsec.net/hub/author/crowdsecurity/configurations/apache_log4j2_cve-2021-44228) is a `Attack scenario` configuration that is designed to detect attacks related to the Apache Log4j2 CVE-2021-44228 vulnerability.

    }}
