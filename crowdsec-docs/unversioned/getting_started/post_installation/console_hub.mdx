# CrowdSec Hub

The [CrowdSec Hub](https://hub.crowdsec.net/) serves as a repository where individuals can access an array of premade configuration files.

These resources are developed by both the CrowdSec team and the broader community, offering a ready-to-use collection for integrating into your own configurations.

### Hub Tour

The CrowdSec Hub is divided into many sections, each of which is designed to help you find the right configuration for your needs.
