# CrowdSec Console

The CrowdSec Console serves as a web-based interface designed for managing your CrowdSec Security Engines effectively. This console comes equipped with an intuitive dashboard, offering a comprehensive visualization of your engines' activities, thereby enhancing the ease of monitoring and analysis.

Additionally, it offers the capability to integrate enhanced functionalities, including the option to incorporate Third-Party blocklists. This feature not only extends the flexibility and adaptability of your security setup but also enables a more robust defense mechanism by leveraging external intelligence sources. 

## Your first Enrollment

### Sign Up

Head over to the [CrowdSec Console](https://app.crowdsec.net/signup) and sign up for a new account.

        sources={{
            light: useBaseUrl("/img/console_login_light.png"),
            dark: useBaseUrl("/img/console_login_dark.png"),
        }}
    />
</a>

### Verify Email

After signing up, you will receive an email to verify your account. Click on the link provided or enter the code in the email to verify your account.

#### Missing Email?

If you don't receive an email, check your spam folder. If you still don't see it, you can request a new verification email by clicking on the "Resend verification email" link on the login page.

If it has been over 30 minutes and you still don't see the email, please [contact us](mailto:support@crowdsec.net)

### Survey

Upon your first login you will get asked some questions to help us understand your use case better.

        light: useBaseUrl("/img/console_signup_survey_light.png"),
        dark: useBaseUrl("/img/console_signup_survey_dark.png"),
    }}
/>

:::info
The survey is optional and you can skip it if you want. We use this information to tailor your experience and to better understand our users.
:::

### Engines page

The first destination after signing up is the engines page. Here you can see all your enrolled engines and their status.

However! since this is your first enrollment, you won't see any engines yet. Let's fix that by enrolling a new engine.

At the very bottom of the page, you will see a code card with a command to run on your engine. This command will install the CrowdSec agent and enroll it to your account.

:::info
`$ENROLLMENT_KEY` is a placeholder for your actual enrollment key.

<UnixWindowsTabs
    bash="sudo cscli console enroll $ENROLLMENT_KEY"
    powershell="cscli.exe console enroll $ENROLLMENT_KEY"
/>
