# FreeBSD

Before getting started it is advised to read the [prerequisites](/unversioned/getting_started/prerequisites.md) page to understand the requirements for running CrowdSec.

# Configuring the repositories

FreeBSD packages are available in the official repositories.

By default, the command `pkg install` should use the quarterly releases (January, April, July and October, updated with security fixes).

You can check `/etc/pkg/FreeBSD.conf` and [change **quarterly** to **latest**](https://wiki.freebsd.org/Ports/QuarterlyBranch) if you feel comfortable upgrading your system.

## Install Security Engine

The CrowdSec package itself can be installed with:

```shell
sudo pkg install crowdsec
```

You'll see a message that tells you how to activate the service:

```shell
sudo sysrc crowdsec_enable="YES"
```

<details>

<summary>Command Output</summary>

```
crowdsec_enable:  -> YES
```

</details>

```shell
sudo service crowdsec start
```

<details>

<summary>Command Output</summary>

```

```

</details>

## Install Remediation Component

:::warning
Security Engine by itself is a detection engine, it will not block anything. You need to install a Remediation Component to enforce decisions
:::

For the quick start guide we will be installing the [PF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PF_(firewall)) firewall Remediation Component. (This may not be optimal for your environment, please refer to the [Remediation Documentation](/bouncers/intro.md) for more information)

To install 

```shell
sudo pkg install crowdsec-firewall-bouncer
```

Then you must enable it with the following commands:

```shell
sudo sysrc crowdsec_firewall_enable="YES"
```

<details>

<summary>Command Output</summary>

```
crowdsec_firewall_enable:  -> YES
```

</details>

```shell
sudo service crowdsec_firewall start
```

<details>

<summary>Command Output</summary>

```
