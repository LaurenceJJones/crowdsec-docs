The [CrowdSec Security Engine](https://github.com/crowdsecurity/crowdsec) is an open-source, lightweight software that detects and blocks malicious actors from accessing your systems at various levels, using log and HTTP Requests analysis with threat patterns called scenarios. 

CrowdSec is a modular framework, offering a variety of [scenarios](https://app.crowdsec.net/hub/collections). Users can choose their protection scenarios and deploy [Remediation Components](https://app.crowdsec.net/hub/bouncers) to block malicious access.

The crowd-sourced aspect allows sharing attack information among users, enhancing real-time attack detection and preemptive blocking of known bad actors from your system.

## Main Features

In addition to the core "detect and react" mechanism, CrowdSec is committed to several other key aspects:

- **Easy Installation**: Effortless out-of-the-box installation on all [supported platforms](/getting_started/versions_matrix.md).
- **Simplified Daily Operations**: Use the [console](http://app.crowdsec.net) and [cscli](/cscli/cscli.md) for effortless maintenance and keeping your detection mechanisms up-to-date.
- **Reproducibility**: The Security Engine can analyze not only live logs but also [cold logs](/u/user_guides/replay_mode), making it easier to detect potential false triggers, conduct forensic analysis, or generate reports.
- **Versatile**: The Security Engine can analyze [system logs](/docs/data_sources/intro) and [HTTP Requests](/docs/next/appsec/intro) to exhaustively protect your perimeter.
- **Observability**: Providing valuable insights into the system's activity:
    - Users can view/manage alerts from the ([Console](https://app.crowdsec.net/signup)).
    - Operations personnel have access to detailed Prometheus metrics ([Prometheus](/observability/prometheus.md)).
    - Administrators can utilize a user-friendly command-line interface tool ([cscli](/observability/cscli.md)).
- **API-Centric**: All components communicate via an [HTTP API](/local_api/intro.md), facilitating multi-machine setups.


## Architecture


<!-- @kka : update schema:
    - align text
    - rename data sources to log sources
    - move log sources out of the SE box
-->

    </div>
</div>

Under the hood, the Security Engine has various components:
 
 - The Log Processor is in charge of detection: it analyzes logs from [various data sources](/docs/data_sources/intro) or [HTTP requests](/appsec/intro.md) from web servers.
 - The [WAF](/appsec/intro.md) feature is part of the Log Processor and filters HTTP Requests from the compatible web servers. 
 - The [Local API](/local_api/intro.md) acts as a middle man between the [Log Processors](/docs/data_sources/intro) and the [Remediation Components](/u/bouncers/intro) which are in charge of enforcing decisions.
 - The [Remediation Components](/u/bouncers/intro) - also known as bouncers - are in charge of blocking bad IPs by using the components already available.

This architecture allows for both simple/standalone setups, or more distributed ones including as illustrated below:

 - One or more machines? Run crowdsec on each (alongside with a remediation component)
 - Already have a log pit (such as rsyslog or loki)? Run crowdsec next to it, not on the production workloads
 - Running Kubernetes? Have a look at [our helm chart](/u/getting_started/installation/kubernetes)
 - Running containers? The [docker data source](/docs/data_sources/docker) might be what you need
 - Just looking for a WAF? Look at [our quickstart](/appsec/intro.md)

Distributed architecture example:
